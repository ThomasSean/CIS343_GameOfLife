# CIS343_GameOfLife

This project was an assigned project in my CIS343 class where we needed to create the game of life using dynamic memory allocation. I was able to compile everything correctly. I was not however able to run it correctly due to lack of memory being addressed. I keep getting a segmentation core dumped error.

Should be run by running executable ./a.out 4 5 life.txt.
